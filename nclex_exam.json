      "explanation": "Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic index and can cause bradycardia. A heart rate below 60 beats per minute is a common reason to hold the dose. While other assessments are important, the heart rate is the most critical for digoxin administration. Option A is a normal blood pressure range, not a contraindication. Option C is within the acceptable range for oxygen saturation. Option D indicates a normal potassium level, which is important as hypokalemia can increase the risk of digoxin toxicity.",

Patients should be instructed to avoid or consult their healthcare provider before taking NSAIDs. Option A is correct as vitamin K in leafy greens can counteract warfarin. Option B is important for maintaining consistent therapeutic levels. Option C highlights a crucial sign of bleeding that requires medical attention.",

Slowing the infusion rate usually resolves the symptoms. Hypoglycemia and bradycardia are not typical adverse effects of vancomycin. Bronchospasm is a rare but possible reaction, but Red man syndrome is more common and directly related to the infusion rate.",

Hypokalemia is generally associated with diuretics, while ACE inhibitors can sometimes cause hyperkalemia. Peripheral edema is more commonly associated with calcium channel blockers. Therefore, monitoring for a dry cough is a key nursing intervention.",

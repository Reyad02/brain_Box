      "explanation": "Warfarin is an anticoagulant, and its effectiveness and safety are primarily monitored by the Prothrombin Time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) to ensure therapeutic anticoagulation while minimizing bleeding risk. A CBC monitors red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. LFTs assess liver function, which is important for drug metabolism but not the primary monitoring tool for warfarin's anticoagulant effect. Serum creatinine assesses kidney function.",

It is not a long-term controller medication or an alternative to inhaled corticosteroids, which target inflammation. It's typically used as needed for acute symptoms, not solely at bedtime.",

While hypoglycemia can occur, it's less common with metformin alone than with some other diabetes medications. Weight gain is not a typical side effect; it can sometimes lead to modest weight loss. Peripheral neuropathy is a complication of diabetes, not a direct side effect of metformin.",

While it does promote potassium excretion, this is a consequence of its primary action. It does not directly promote water reabsorption or block aldosterone.",

Ototoxicity (hearing damage) and nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) are also potential serious adverse effects of vancomycin, but they are typically dose-related and occur over time, not specifically with rapid infusion. Photosensitivity is not a common side effect of vancomycin.",
